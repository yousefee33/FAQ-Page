 <div class="content-container">
    <div class="question">What is your education background?</div>
    <div class="answer">Im currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science at MSA University, Cairo, Egypt, with an expected graduation year of 2027</div>
 </div>
 <div class="content-container">
    <div class="question"> What technologies and tools do you specialize in?</div>
    <div class="answer">I specialize in full-stack web development (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React.js, PHP, MySQL) and cybersecurity tools (Wireshark, Metasploit, TryHackMe labs). I also work with Python for data analysis (OpenCV, NumPy) and C++ for systems programming. My cloud experience includes AWS fundamentals and scalable app deployment.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="content-container">
    <div class="question">Can you describe a challenging project and how you solved it?</div>
    <div class="answer">For my Court Booking Management System, I faced scalability issues with PHP/MySQL. I optimized database queries, added caching, and redesigned the UI for faster load times—cutting latency by 40%. This taught me the importance of performance-first development and user-centric debugging.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="content-container">
    <div class="question">How do you stay updated with industry trends?</div>
    <div class="answer">I’m proactive:

Cybersecurity: TryHackMe challenges and SOC analysis workshops.

Web Dev: Following React.js updates and CSS frameworks like Tailwind.

Cloud: AWS Educate courses and hands-on labs.
I also contribute to open-source projects and tech communities.</div>
    </div>
 <div class="content-container">
    <div class="question">What interests you about cybersecurity?</div>
    <div class="answer">I’m passionate about threat detection and protecting systems—inspired by projects like reverse-engineering game cracks. My goal is to become a SOC analyst, blending my coding skills with tools like SIEM (Splunk) and IDS/IPS to defend networks.</div>
